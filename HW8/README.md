## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:
Ensured PEP8 compliance. Explored and cleaned dataset. Adjusted parameters to ensure good scores.

### Ben Flaggs:
Created and fit with classifiers. Found four most important features. Some captions and descriptions made.

### Nik Korzoun:
Created confusion matrices. Assisted with fitting training data and testing scores with test data. Some captions and descriptions made.
### Connor Mooney:
Created loss functions. Assisted in finding beset four features. Plotted ROC curve. Some captions and descriptions made.

## Questions
1. This homework is about using different tree-based classification algorithms to distinguish higgs boson decay signatures from noise.
2. The hardest part of this homework was interpreting the results of the classification in the context of the particle physics data.
3. The easiest part of this homework was programming and calculating the loss functions that we have used before in this class.
4. I learned that overfitting can be determined from comparing the scores of the training set and testing set.
