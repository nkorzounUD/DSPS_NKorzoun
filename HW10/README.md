## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:
Imported, cleaned, and reshaped headshot images of training and test data for headshot assignment.

### Ben Flaggs:
Created loss vs epoch plots for digit assignment, created model using FFNN to reconstruct images of digits, and created figure captions for FFNN digit assignment.

### Nik Korzoun:
Created loss vs epoch plots for headshot assignment, created model with a given loss function and optimizer, and added many figure captions for headshot assignment.

### Connor Mooney:
Imported, cleaned, and reconstructed headshot image of Connor's headshot. Added some captions for headshot assignment.

## Questions
1. This homework is about creating a feed forward neural net that can predict digits from images and increase the resolution of the image of a face.
2. The hardest part of this homework was finding the best combination of activation function and optimizer to design our neural net.
3. The easiest part of this homework was creating the training and testing sets
4. I learned neural networks do not always have to be very computationally intensive for a particular task.
