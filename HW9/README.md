## Questions
1. This homework is about exploring different layers of the deep dream neural network.
2. The hardest part of this homework was finding a layer in the image which produced detailed changes, rather than just shapes or textures
3. The easiest part of this homework was changing the different parameters of the deep dream.
4. I learned that each layer can look very different from the previous layer despite coming from the same original image.
