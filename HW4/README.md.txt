## Contributions
Members of this group were Andrew Crossman, Ben Flaggs, Nik Korzoun (myself), and Connor Mooney. Andrew Crossman derived the dependence of v^2 on r in a Newtonian framework, assisted in dubugging/writing the `vratios` function, and wrote the code for solving problem 1 in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf). Ben Flaggs read in and cleaned up the galaxy data, found the angular and physical size of M31, drafted the `getradii` function, and assisted in debugging the code for problem 1 in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf). Nik Korzoun wrote the `vratios` function, repeated all necessary steps to make plots for the MW galaxy, assisted in debugging the code for problem 1 in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf), and managed code branches. Connor Mooney assisted in the final draft of the `getradii` function, wrote the `plotGal` function, and assisted in debugging the code for problem 1 in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf).

## Questions
1. This homework was about showing that Newtonian physics does not completely describe galactic rotation, implying the existence of dark matter many radii away from the center of galaxies. Additionally, we practiced a moment analysis for a Laplacian distribution and observed how the law of large numbers affects the calculated moments from a sample.
2. The hardest part of this homework was interpreting how kurtosis is calcluated and applying it to a Laplacian distrubtion 
3. The easiest part of this homework was formatting our galaxy rotational curve plots (color, legend, plot range, etc...)
4. I learned that the Andromeda galaxy contains more dark matter than the Milky Way
