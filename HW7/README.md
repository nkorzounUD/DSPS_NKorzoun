## Contributions
### Andrew Crossman:
Ensured PEP8 compliance.

### Ben Flaggs:
Assisted in preprocessing data. Calculated intracluster variance. Applied k-means clustering and plotted variance over number of clusters. Plotted k-means clusters on 2d projection.

### Nik Korzoun:
Assisted with intracluster variance and plotting variance over number of clusters. Created distance matrix, histogram of pairwise distances, and applied DBSCAN clustering to 2d TSNE projection.

### Connor Mooney:
Preprocessed the data. Plotted the TSNE projection. Created agglomerative clustering dendrograms and 2D agglomerative clusters plot.


## Questions
1. This homework was about applying various clustering methods to a multidimensional dataset. Most of the algorithms produced similar results.
2. The hardest part of this homework was trying to understand the high-dimensionality of the dataset, and visualizing how the distances between each point, the intracluster variances, and their projections into a two-dimensional space.
3. The easiest part of this homework was calculating the pairwise distance matrix, though it took a long time to run.
4. I learned that the Manhattan Distance can be obtained from the Minkowski metric
