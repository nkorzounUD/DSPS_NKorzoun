## Contributions
Members of this group were Andrew Crossman, Ben Flaggs, Nik Korzoun, and Connor Mooney. Andrew Crossman made plot labels, checked the notebook for errors, then consulted formatting for PEP8. Ben Flaggs retrieved the data set from the SCEDC earthquake catalog, assisted with reading in, preparing, and selecting valuable data, assisted in making the histograms in the data exploration section, and aided with understanding of the pseudocode. Nik Korzoun implemented the KS test, remade Fig. 1 and Table 1 from Corral 2018, and maintained code branches. Connor Mooney also assisted with reading in, preparing, and selecting valuable data, assisted in making histograms and aided with understanding of the pseudocode.

## Summary
1. This homework was about reproducing the results of a scientific paper on earthquake time offsets, which included the implementation of a KS-test to compare seismological data.
2. The hardest part of this homework was learning to use broadcasting in python, and using appropriate datatypes for each function.
3. The easiest part of this assignment was displaying data tables with pandas, whether for debugging or visualising our final data.
4. I learned how to use broadcasting in python.
